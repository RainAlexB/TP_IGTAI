### Ray tracing project

The objective of this project is to implement a 3D rendering by ray-tracing. Image generation is done by calculating the intersection of rays with the surfaces of the objects in the 3d scene. Is object has a geometry and a material. At each intersection point, a lighting simulation is done such that the result is a color going in the direction of the ray.
